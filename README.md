# NTU Quantum Computing Summer School 2020
National Taiwan University (NTU) provides a three-day summer school on Quantum compuing. The courses start from Aug. 04 to Aus. 06 in 2020 summer. In the summer school, we cover both theory and demos based IBM Quantum Computers. In this repository, we provide the materials, including codes, lecture notes, and supplementary information for your reference.

The summer school consists of theory lectures (in the mornings) and demonstrations (in the afternoons).


# Qiskit
Qiskit (Quantum Information Software Kit) is an open source released by IBM QUantum Team based on Python, and can be used in programming quantum computing experiments and computations. We will teach the participants from the installation to conducting your first quantum program.

## Installation
- macOS
- Windows
